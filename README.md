Second Scrim: WUJU Warriors

1-4 (When Pushing A Main take control then one can stay there and 1 can watch squeaky.) - A SITE

1-2 (Right when Kiizuro died you should have played retake) - B SITE

2-5 (WHAT IS THAT ANGLE IN VENTS, Sit Right Corner and watch Mid Kiizuro watching B Main) - VENTS

3-5 (Jax counter flash please) - A SITE

3-6 (You used both flashes before they even pushed site) - A SITE

3-9 (Shroud Boost, Loving It) - A SITE

Positioning on A site was atrocious. (WILL GO OVER at PRACTICE)

After we Push something (A Main, Middle, B Main whatever) DO NOT PLAY Aggressive even if you are flashed in with a teammate they will be waiting for you. -SOMETHING TO NOTE



WILL ADD MORE LATER
